# Bifid Cipher/Decipher 1.0
A simple Bifid Cipher/Decipher written in C.

## Description

The Bifid Cipher is a cipher which combines the Polybius square with transposition, and uses fractionation to achieve diffusion. 

Simple but effective.

* It's open source, you can do any changes. It's a bit dirty and messy but works :)
* You can cipher/dicipher how many times you want (the decrypted message won't be deciphered easily :D )
* You can customize your table. Give it to your closest friend and start sending decrypted messages.

P.S.: You cannot write sentences, only 'not spaced sentence', but feel free to modify my code to achieve it. Look in comments :)
